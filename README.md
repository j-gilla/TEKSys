Q1.
Write a function where it takes in the cost, and the payment, and then return an object of the change in UK coins and notes.

e.g. getChange(5.34, 20) returns
{
1000: 1,
200: 2
50: 1,
10: 1,
5: 1,
1: 1
}

NB: 1000 = Â£10, 1 = 1p etc.

Q2.
Using HTML and CSS, create a simple view for mobile similar to Instagram where the main navigation is at the bottom, and the content is scrollable view of multiple rows with 3 equal columns. (The navigation does not need to be functional, this is just a styling test)
